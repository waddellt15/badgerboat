synopsis = The manifest test utility is a convenience utility for
  manifest authors. It will check for syntax and semantic correctness
  of manifest files. Ideally this utility is used by all manifest
  authors prior to sharing their content. This utility is included in
  the MOOS-IvP codebase in releases after 17.7, and in the development
  trunk as of this writing.
