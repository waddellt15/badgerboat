synopsis = The ALog Toolbox provides a number of utilities for post-mission 
  analysis and/or editing of mission log files. They all assume the 
  .alog file format produced by pLogger. There are two groups of tools, 
  graphical tools (alogview) and command line tools (alogscan, aloggrep, 
  alogrm etc).
