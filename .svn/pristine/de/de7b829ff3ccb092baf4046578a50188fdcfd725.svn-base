The app now allows a zone/region to be associated with each alert. 

 alert = id=trail, var=INVADER_INFO, val="name=$[VNAME] # contact=$[VNAME]"
 alert = id=trail, alert_range=400
 alert = id=trail, cpa_range=600
 alert = id=trail, alert_range_color=green
 alert = id=trail, inzone_post="$[VNAME] has entered the zone!!"
 alert = id=trail, outzone_post="$[VNAME] has exited the zone!!"
 alert = id=trail, region=pts={-12.8,-13.5 :-85,-48 :-50.5,-120.2}

If a region is configured for an alert, then a contact must satisfy
BOTH the range criteria AND the region criteria. 

If the user wants to just use range criteria, don't specify a region.

If the user wants to just use region criteria, set ranges to zero.
