synopsis = The zaic_vect utility launches a simple GUI rendering a
  utility function, piecewise defined, over one discrete variable. The
  pieces are formed by a few parameters provided to an instance of the
  ZAIC_VECT utility in the IvPBuild Toolbox. The GUI user has the
  ability to change the ZAIC_VECT parameters via the keyboard and watch
  the effects of these changes as the rendering of the utility
  function is updated.
