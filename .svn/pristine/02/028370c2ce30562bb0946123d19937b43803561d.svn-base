synopsis = The uField Toolbox contains a number of tools for supporting 
   multi-vehicle missions where each vehicle is connected to a shoreside 
   community. This includes both simulation and real field experiments. 
   It also contains a number of simulated sensors that run on off-board 
   the vehicle on the shoreside.
