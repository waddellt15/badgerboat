  pGPSd Requirements

  This package is intended to provide a connection between a gpsd server and a MOOS community. It publishes the most critical GPS/GNSS outputs as individual variables and also publishes each JSON message received from gpsd. This allows a MOOS community to get access to AIS messages or more detailed GPS/GNSS information.

  For user convenience, pGPSd also periodically calculates and publishes the magnetic declination.
